<h1>Section 3: How to get your first credit card?</h1>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>In order to get your first credit card you need to apply in the respective credit card's application link. 
    You either get approved or rejected for the credit card and many different factors affect this decision. Some
    credit cards require a good credit score, a good income, and a great credit history in order to get 
    accepted for the credit card. For beginners into their credit journey, there are applications for student credit cards or 
    secured credit cards that are much easier to get accepted for.

    name, etc. and information about your income as well. When you are ready to apply, you have to go to the application link for a 
    certain credit card and fill out this information truthfully. You will usually receive an approval for your credit card instantly
    or sometimes it takes 24 hours.
