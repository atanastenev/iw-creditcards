<h1>Section 2: Why are credit cards beneficial?</h1>
<h4>Sign-Up Bonuses</h4>
<p>When applying and getting approved for certain credit cards, they have one-time sign-up bonuses. These bonuses can include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>actual cash (from $150 to $1000) for spending a certain amount with you credit cards the first couple of months of owning it</li>
    <li>credit cards reward points</li>
    <li>travel points/miles</li>
</ul>
<p>These sign-up bonuses are basically free cash and rewards that can be redemeed in many ways. From store credit to cash to pay off
    the credit card, having a sign-up bonus is a great way to start your credit card jouney.
</p>
<h4>Cash Back</h4>
<p>For every transaction you make, a certain percentage, usually 1%, 2%, or 3% of the transaction amount will be rebated or given 
    back in the form of cash back. After a certain time this cash back can be redemeed as actual cash, store credit, etc.
</p>
<h4>Reward Points</h4>
<p>Many reward credit cards provide bonus points for certain categories of spending like restaurants, groceries or gasoline. 
    When certain earnings thresholds are reached, points can be redeemed for travel, gift cards from retailers and restaurants, 
    or for merchandise items through the credit card company's online rewards portal. </p>
<h4>Airfair Miles</h4>
<p>Certain banks that have credit cards that are affeliated with airlines and one can earn many travel points to redeem 
    free flights or get discounted prices on flights once they redeem the Airline miles/points.
</p>
<h4>Grace Period</h4>
<p> When you make a debit card purchase, your money is gone right away. When you make a credit card purchase, your money 
    remains in your checking account until you pay your credit card bill. 
    Hanging on to your funds for this extra time can be helpful in two ways. 
    First, the time value of money, however infinitesimal, will save you money. Delaying eventual payment makes your 
    purchase a tiny bit cheaper than it would be otherwise. Second, when you consistently pay with a credit card you don't 
    have to watch your bank account balance as closely. </p>
<h4>Building Credit</h4>
<p>If you have no credit or are trying to improve your credit score, using a credit card responsibly will help 
    because credit card companies will report your payment activity to the credit bureaus. However, debit card use 
    doesn't appear anywhere on your credit report, so it can't help you build or improve your credit. 
    Even if you need to deposit some funds to get a secured credit card, this can help you build your 
    credit history and eventually qualify for unsecured cards or larger loans for future purchases such as cards and real estate. </p>

<h1>Different Types of Credit Cards</h1>
<p>There are many different types of credit cards, ranging from travel credit cards to business credit cards to secured credit cards.
    The three beginner types of credit cards that will get you started on your credit journey include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Secured Credit Cards:</b> Most credit cards are unsecured, meaning you don't have to put down any collateral. 
        With secured credit cards, on the other hand, you're required to put down a cash deposit in order to secure a small 
        line of credit, usually for a similar amount. For example, you might sign up for a secured credit card and put down a 
        $500 initial deposit in order to receive a $500 line of credit. The one-time deposit (and therefore credit limit) can 
        be as low as $49. While putting down collateral may not seem ideal, secured credit cards are the easiest type of credit 
        card to get approved for, so they are often helpful when you need to build credit from scratch or want to repair your 
        credit after a financial hurdle.</li>
    <li><b>Student Credit Cards:</b> These credit cards are for young people who don't necessarily have a credit history.
    These credit cards have lesser requirements leading to more people getting approved for them in order to start on their credit journey,
    accumulate a credit score and become aligible to get better credit cards later on.</li>
    <li><b>Cash Back Credit Cards:</b> Cash back credit cards make it easy for you to earn cash back or statement credits on 
        your spending, although how rewards are doled out varies from card to card. Some options in this niche offer a flat rate 
        of rewards while others offer bonus points in certain categories like dining or travel. Some even offer bonus rewards in 
        categories that change each quarter, as well as a flat rate of rewards on all non-bonus purchases.</li>
