<h1>Section 1: What are credit cards?</h1>
<h4>Difference Between Debit Cards and Credit Cards</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitcard.asp" style="color:black;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debit card</a> uses funds that you have from your bank account. 
    A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditcard.asp" style="color:black;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit card</a> uses a credit line that can be paid back later, which gives you more time to pay. 
    A customer's credit line depends on their creditworthiness, and they can decide how and when to 
    spend the line of credit and are usually billed on a monthly cycle.</p>
<p>A debit card is issued by a bank to their customers to access funds without having to write a paper check or make a cash withdrawal. 
    When you use a debit card, the money is automatically taken out of your checking account. 
    When you use a credit card, you pay the bill later. You can't use your debit card if your bank account is empty, 
    but you can use a credit card as long as you don't exceed your credit limit. 
    Besides, credit cards can help you build up your credit or hurt it. </p>

<h4>What is a Credit Line?</h4>
<p>A credit card does not just have unlimited balance for one to spend. 
    Credit cards usually come with a set <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/credit_limit.asp" style="color:black;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit limit</a> (say $500, $2,500, or $25,000) based 
    on the cardholder's <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrating.asp" style="color:black;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">credit rating</a> and income. Credit cards allow consumers to carry a balance 
    from month to month, on which they must pay interest. In general, a credit card issuer will raise 
    your credit limit as you spend more and make regular payments.
</p>

<h4>GOLDEN RULE of Credit Cards</h4>
<p>When you're a credit card owner, you need to be disciplined in not spending over your credit limit and paying off
    your credit card, either throughout the monthly timefram between statements or after monthly statements come out.
    The GOLDEN RULE of Credit Cards is never spend more than your credit limit and NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE (in your
    immediate funds from banks) A great addition to the GOLDEN RULE is ideally to pay off all of your credit card fees as soon as possible. Don't necessarily just
    pay off your minimum fee and move on to spending, make sure to apply the GOLDEN RULE. <b>Never spend more that you cannot
    pay off right away.</b> </p>

<p>There are many useful tools to help you track your spending and funds all in one place. You can obviously 
    check you credit card and bank account funds directly from their online bank apps or websites, but applications exist
    that you can connect all of your bank accounts in order to check and track all in one place if you feel that you
    have too many accounts on different platforms. A great financial/spending tracking app is <a href="
